We’ll explore what a service mesh is, how it integrates with Kubernetes, and why it’s essential for managing modern microservice architectures.

## What is Service Mesh?

A Service Mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer designed to handle the communication between microservices. 
Instead of embedding communication logic inside each service, 
the service mesh abstracts this away, allowing developers to focus on building the core functionality of their services.

```
export async function getSource() {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}
```

## Why use MDX?

MDX is a great way to write interactive documentation, blog posts, and other
content that requires more than just plain text. By using MDX, you can easily
embed interactive components, code snippets, and other dynamic content in your
Markdown files.

## How to use MDX

To use MDX, you need to install a plugin for your static site generator or build
tool. For example, if you're using Gatsby, you can use the `gatsby-plugin-mdx`
plugin to enable MDX support in your project.

Once you have the plugin installed, you can start writing MDX files by creating
files with the `.mdx` extension and writing JSX inside them.

## Conclusion

MDX is a powerful tool that allows you to write JSX in your Markdown files. This
post has introduced you to the basics of MDX and explained why you might want to
use it in your projects.
